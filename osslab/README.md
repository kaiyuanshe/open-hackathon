# setup python
after all the preconditions are met on your dev machine, install the required python libraries via pip by:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`.

Note that the file may not up-to-date. When you see error like `no module named XXX`, that means you need install
the specific lib in the error message, try `pip install XXX` in this case.

# setup mysql
configure your mysql instance to add users/privileges. DON'T use root user.

logon mysql console with `root` user(`mysql -u root -p`) and then:

```
create database hackathon;
create User 'hackathon'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED by 'your_password';
GRANT ALL on hackathon.* TO 'hackathon'@'localhost';
```
Next update `app/config.py` with your user/password.  And don't submit your password to github.

## configure logs

```
sudo mkdir /var/log/osslab
sudo chown www-data:www-data /var/log/osslab


## initialize tables
run `python src/setup_db.py` for the first time to create db tables;

# run
change directory to `osslab/src` and run `python run.py` to start the flask server.

By default the server will listen on port `80` and run in debug model. You can edit run.py to listen a different port.

Browse to `http://localhost` to see the welcome page to make sure its ready.

## notice on windows
you cannot listen on port 80 by default on windows since the windows http service is listening on 80. Try run `net stop http`
on command line to stop http service and release 80 port. Moreover, you may want to run `sc config http start= disabled` to
prevent http service from being started automatically during windows reboot. _After this, you cannot start IIS any more. Start
`http` service if you do need IIS_.

# install apache2 if you want to deploy the flask on the apache2

1. install apache2 via `sudo apt-get install apache2`
2. update config files at `sites-enabled/000-default.conf`. See [this article](http://blog.163.com/sywxf_backup/blog/static/21151212520128202312687/) for more help.
3. open 80 port on firewall or azure cloud service.
