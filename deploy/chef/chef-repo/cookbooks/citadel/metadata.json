  "long_description": "Citadel cookbook\n================\n\nUsing a combination of IAM roles, S3 buckets, and EC2 it is possible to use AWS\nas a trusted-third-party for distributing secret or otherwise sensitive data.\n\nOverview\n--------\n\nIAM roles allow specifying snippets of IAM policies in a way that can be used\nfrom an EC2 virtual machine. Combined with a private S3 bucket, this can be\nused to authorize specific hosts to specific files.\n\nIAM Roles can be created [in the AWS Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#roles).\nWhile the policies applied to a role can be changed later, the name cannot so\nbe careful when choosing them.\n\nIAM Policy\n----------\n\nBy default, your role will not be able to access any files in your private S3\nbucket. You can create IAM policies that whitelist specific keys for each role:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Version\": \"2008-10-17\",\n  \"Id\": \"<policy name>\",\n  \"Statement\": [\n    {\n      \"Sid\": \"<statement name>\",\n      \"Effect\": \"Allow\",\n      \"Principal\": {\n        \"AWS\": \"arn:aws:iam::<AWS account number>:role/<role name>\"\n      },\n      \"Action\": \"s3:GetObject\",\n      \"Resource\": \"arn:aws:s3:::<bucket name>/<key pattern>\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThe key pattern can include `*` and `?` metacharacters, so for example\n`arn:aws:s3:::myapp.citadel/deploy_keys/*` to allow access to all files in the\n`deploy_keys` folder.\n\nThis policy can be attached to either the IAM role or the S3 bucket with equal\neffect.\n\nLimitations\n-----------\n\nEach EC2 VM can only be assigned a single IAM role. This can complicate situations\nwhere some secrets need to be shared by overlapping subsets of your servers. A\npossible improvement to this would be to make a script to create all needed\ncomposite IAM roles, possibly driven by Chef roles or other metadata.\n\nAttributes\n----------\n\n* `node['citadel']['bucket']` – The default S3 bucket to use.\n\nRecipe Usage\n------------\n\nYou can access secret data via the `citadel` method.\n\n```ruby\nfile '/etc/secret' do\n  owner 'root'\n  group 'root'\n  mode '600'\n  content citadel['keys/secret.pem']\nend\n```\n\nBy default the node attribute `node['citadel']['bucket']` is used to find the\nS3 bucket to query, however you can override this:\n\n```ruby\ntemplate '/etc/secret' do\n  owner 'root'\n  group 'root'\n  mode '600'\n  variables secret: citadel('mybucket')['id_rsa']\nend\n```\n\nDeveloping with Vagrant\n-----------------------\n\nWhile developing in a local VM, you can use the node attributes\n`node['citadel']['access_key_id']` and `node['citadel']['secret_access_key']`\nto provide credentials. The recommended way to do this is via environment variables\nso that the Vagrantfile itself can still be kept in source control without\nleaking credentials:\n\n```ruby\nconfig.vm.provision :chef_solo do |chef|\n  chef.json = {\n    citadel: {\n      access_key_id: ENV['ACCESS_KEY_ID'],\n      secret_access_key: ENV['SECRET_ACCESS_KEY'],\n    },\n  }\nend\n```\n\n**WARNING:** Use of these attributes in production should be considered a likely\nsecurity risk as they will end up visible in the node data, or in the role/environment/cookbook\nthat sets them. This can be mitigated using Enterprise Chef ACLs, however such\nconfigurations are generally error-prone due to the defaults being wide open.\n\nRecommended Folder Layout\n-------------------------\n\nWithin your S3 bucket I recommend you create one folder for each group of\nsecrets, and in your IAM policies have one statement per group. Each group of\nsecrets is a set of data with identical security requirements. Many groups will\nstart out only containing a single file, however having the flexibility to\nchange this in the future allows for things like key rotation without rewriting\nall of your IAM policies.\n\nManaging Secrets\n----------------\n\nYou can use any S3 client you prefer to manage your secrets, however make sure\nthat new files are set to private (accessible only to the creating user) by\ndefault.\n",
