# Getting Started
This document will tell you how to setup your local development environment for open-hackathon API service as well as the API list.

# Setup

This guide show you how to setup your local development environment quickly.

### Install MySQL
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install mysql-server libmysqlclient-dev
```

### Install docker
Follow [docker instalation guide] to install docker. You can choose install the latest version of docker. But we strongly recommend you to
 install a stable version since docker itself is developing and updating. Usually lasted version has unexpected issues.

after docker installed, you need pull down some required docker images:
```
sudo docker pull sffamily/ubuntu-gnome-vnc-eclipse
sudo docker pull rastasheep/ubuntu-sshd
sudo docker pull hall/guacamole
```

##### enable docker remote api
If you want to use docker remote api to visit docker on your host machine or Azure server, please change the following configure:
Please edit this file: `/etc/init/docker.conf` or `/etc/default/docker` and update the `DOCKER_OPTS` variable to the following:
```
DOCKER_OPTS = '-H tcp://0.0.0.0:4243 -H unix:///var/run/docker.sock'
```
The daemon process will listen on port '4243', if '4243' port has been occupied on the machine which you want to visit, please change it.
If you want to know the information of containers, please enter the address like following (Only running containers are shown by default):
`http://localhost:4243/containers/json`
If you want to inspect a specified container's information, you can input this:
`http://localhost:4243/containers/<container id or name>/json`
More information docker remote api you can visit:
`https://docs.docker.com/reference/api/docker_remote_api_v1.16/`
And add user into docker group
```
sudo groupadd docker
sudo gpasswd -a ${USER} docker
```
Then restart the docker process: `service docker.io restart`


### Clone SourceCode

first of all, make sure `git` installed. Please follow the [Git installation guide](http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) in case it's not ready.
And then clone source code from github to your local system. Any local folder is OK, we will clone to `/opt` in this document. However you
can change it to any directory you want.
```
cd /opt/
git clone https://github.com/msopentechcn/open-hackathon.git
```

**_Notice that you MUST [folk](http://www.worldhello.net/gotgithub/04-work-with-others/010-fork-and-pull.html) the repository to your account/organization before contributing any changes. Pull Requests are welcome._**

### Setup Guacamole
for simplicity, we recommend you start guacamole using `docker`.
```
sudo docker run -d -i -t -p 8080:8080 -v /opt/open-hackathon/deploy/guacamole:/etc/guacamole hall/guacamole
```
change the port and directory if needed. Also make sure `guacamole.properties` file is correctly configured. The file is in
<<<<<<< HEAD
directory `/opt/open-hackathon/deploy/guacamole` and it's right for you local environment by default. The content may look like:
```
# Hostname and port of guacamole proxy
guacd-hostname: localhost
guacd-port:     4822

lib-directory: /etc/guacamole

# Auth provider class (authenticates user/pass combination, needed if using the provided login screen)
auth-provider: com.openhackathon.guacamole.OpenHackathonAuthenticationProvider
auth-request-url: http://osslab.msopentech.cn:15000/api/guacamoleconfig
```
Usually the only config need to update is `auth-request-url`. _You need to stop the guacamole container and start another one
in case `guacamole.properties` updated_.
directory `/opt/open-hackathon/deploy/guacamole` and it's right for you local environment by default. Usually the only config need to update is `auth-request-url`.
_You need to stop the guacamole container and start another one in case `guacamole.properties` updated_.

##### install guacamole manually(not via docker)
in case you want to install guacamole locally rather than docker , refer to [instrutions](https://github.com/msopentechcn/open-hackathon/wiki/Setup-Guacamole-withn-custom-authentication) for the detailed steps.

### Install Pathon and Python modules
download [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and add script `python` to your `$PATH`. Make sure the version of python is 2.7.
python 3.* may be supported but we didn't test it.
And install required libs:
```
sudo apt-get install python-dev python-setuptools
sudo easy_install pip
cd /opt/open-hackathon/
sudo pip install -r open-hackathon/requirement.txt
```

### Configure MySQL
Make sure the MySQL is using `utf-8` charset. Edit `/etc/mysql/my.conf` make changes like this:
```
[client]
default-character-set=utf8

[mysqld]
default-storage-engine=INNODB
character-set-server=utf8
collation-server=utf8_general_ci
```
Then restart the `mysqld` service by `service mysqld restart`

Next logon mysql console with root user(`mysql -u root -p`) and then:
```mysql
create database hackathon;
create User 'hackathon'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED by 'hackathon';
GRANT ALL on hackathon.* TO 'hackathon'@'localhost';
```
Next update `app/config.py` with your user/password. And don't submit your password to github!!!

Then we should initialize tables and creat test data:
```
sudo python /opt/open-hackathon/open-hackathon/src/setup_db.py
sudo python /opt/open-hackathon/open-hackathon/src/create_test_data.py
```
### Run
one more step, make sure log folder is created and properly authorized.
```
sudo mkdir /var/log/open-hackathon
sudo chmod -R 644 /var/log/open-hackathon
```
Everything is OK now! Start the API server in command line:
```
cd /opt/open-hackathon/open-hackathon/src
sudo python run.py
```
open your brower and navigate to the health page, by default it should be http://localhost:15000

if the status shown is "OK", everything is done.

### Debug
We recommend you install [PyCharm Community Version](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/) to debug our code. Of course you can
choose other IDE but you need to figure out how to debug by yourself.
make sure `debug` mode is set `True` in file `/opt/open-hackathon/open-hackathon/src/run.py`. Start PyCharm and:
- open your project
- and click`Run -> Edit Configuration`
- add an new `python` configuration. Fill the required blanks and Apply
- click Debug Icon(a spider icon) in toolbar to start debugging

# API
See [API wiki](https://github.com/msopentechcn/open-hackathon/wiki/Open-hackathon-Restful-API) for details of the RestAPI exposed.
